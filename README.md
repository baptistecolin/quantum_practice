## quantum_practice

I'm trying to figure out how [QISKit](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py) works and I'm basically following their tutorial.

I managed to create a 3-qbit Bell State and to observe how intricate it is (which is, very very much), using local simulations and quantum cloud computing.

Please move on to the [notebook](https://github.com/baptistecolin/quantum_practice/blob/master/intrication.ipynb) to see the code and results.

### to do :

Mostly implement other algorithms, just to practice (Shor, teleportation, Deutsch-Josza, Grover ...)
